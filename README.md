Hello World?!

I'm embarassed to admit that I'm fighting a VERY strong urge to google "what to say in hello world message" ha.  I can't be the first person to think that, right?  

What can I say other than this is new to me and I'm excited to be venturing into the world of GitHub.  Here goes nothing... :)

CH out!
